/**Middleware in Express.js
 * is a function that gets executed between the incoming request and the outgoing response
 * Execution Order: Middleware functions are always invoked in the order they are added
 *
 * Access to Request and Response: Middleware functions have access to the request object,
 * the response object, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle
 *
 * Tasks Performed: Middleware functions can execute any code,
 * make changes to the request and the response objects,
 * end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack
 *
 * Types of Middleware: An Express application can use several types of middleware,
 * including application-level middleware, router-level middleware, error-handling middleware,
 * built-in middleware, and third-party middleware
 *
 * Middleware Chaining: Middleware can be chained from one to another,
 * creating a chain of functions that are executed in order.
 * The next() function in Express.js is responsible for calling the next middleware function if there is one
 *
 * In essence,
 * middleware functions are a way to encapsulate functionality that needs to happen before the final route handler is called.
 * They can be used for a variety of tasks, such as logging, authentication, validation, and more1
